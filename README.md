# Features

Program accepts any `.txt` or `.md` file or a folder/directory of `.txt`/`.md` files and converts them to .html files for use in webpages. 

HTML files consist of `<p>` tags for text and `<br/>` for spaces from text. 

Will also process markdown file features including `<h1>`, `<h2>` for titles, `<strong>` and `<em>` for bold and italics, and `<a>` for links

Also will create a `<title>` and `<h1>` out of the first line in a text file if it is followed by 2 new lines.

Allows for user to specify output folder for HTML files generated by the program. If specified folder doesn't exist a new temp one will be created.
