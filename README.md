# Changelog

**0.1.5:**

1. **Markdown Syntax Support**: Markdown syntax features, such as italics, bold, headings (Heading 1 and Heading 2), and links. This means it can correctly format these elements when converting Markdown to HTML. If you specify a single Markdown file it processes that file and saves the HTML output in the "testml" directory. Also If you run the script with a directory path it processes Markdown files within that directory and saves the generated HTML files in the "testml" directory.

2. **Output Directory**: custom output directory and the script will save the HTML output in the specified directory.
